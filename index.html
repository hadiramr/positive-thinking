                positive thinking</a>
            helps with stress management and can even improve your health. Practice overcoming negative self-talk
            Positive thinking <strong> doesn't mean that</strong> you ignore life's less pleasant situations. Positive
            thinking
            just means that
            you approach unpleasantness in a more positive and productive way. You think the best is going to happen,
            not the
            worst.Positive thinking often starts with self-talk. Self-talk is the endless stream of unspoken thoughts
            that run
            through your head. These automatic thoughts can be positive or negative. Some of your self-talk comes from
            logic
            and
            reason. Other self-talk may arise from misconceptions that you create because of lack of information or
            expectations
            due to preconceived ideas of what may happen
